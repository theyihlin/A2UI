# A2UI in MCP Apps Sample

This sample demonstrates a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Application Host that isolation-tests untrusted third-party Angular components via a secure double-iframe proxy pattern.

## Architecture

- **`client/`**: The host container application (Angular). It hosts the outer safe iframe.
- **`server/`**: The MCP Server (Python/uv) that provides the micro-app resources and tools.
- **`server/apps/src/`**: Source code for the **Basic** isolated micro-app.
- **`server/apps/editor/`**: Source code for the **Editor** isolated micro-app.

## Communication Flow

    participant Server as MCP Server
    participant Host as Client Host Application
    participant Proxy as Sandbox Proxy
    participant App as MCP App (Sandbox)
    participant A2UI as A2UI Surface

    Note over Host: 1. Loaded from Hosting server
    Host->>Server: 2. Fetch MCP App resource
    Server-->>Host: Return MCP App resource
    Host->>Proxy: 3a. Load Sandbox Proxy
    Proxy->>App: 3b. Serve App in isolated iframe

    Note over App: 4. CTA triggers relay request
    App->>Proxy: Request tool call
    Proxy->>Host: Relay Request
    Host->>Server: Forward Tool Call
    Server-->>Host: 5. Respond with A2UI JSON payload
    Host->>Proxy: Relay payload
    Proxy->>App: 6. Hand down payload to MCP App

    App->>A2UI: 7. Renders A2UI Components
    Note over A2UI: Click on A2UI Button

    A2UI->>App: 8. A2UI Button triggers UserAction
    App->>Proxy: Forward UserAction event
    Proxy->>Host: Relay UserAction to Host
    Note over Host: 9. Map Action to Tool Call
    Host->>Server: Forward Tool Call
    Server-->>Host: 10. Respond with A2UI payload (datamodelupdate)
    Host->>Proxy: Relay payload
    Proxy->>App: 11. Pipe payload to MCP App
    App->>A2UI: Update rendering
```

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/) with `uv`

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Pre-build Core Dependencies

The sample apps link to local versions of the A2UI SDK. You **must build the core libraries** before attempting to run `npm install` inside any sample subdirectories.

Run the following from the repository root:

```bash
# 1. Web Core
cd renderers/web_core && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..

# 2. Markdown Utilities
cd renderers/markdown/markdown-it && npm install && npm run build && cd ../../..

# 3. Angular Renderer SDK
cd renderers/angular && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..
```

## Build & Regeneration

This sample relies on generated bundle artifacts.

### 1. Build Client Sandbox Bridge

The sandboxed iframe needs its asset bundle. Run this in the `client/` directory:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run build:sandbox
```

_(Generates `client/public/sandbox_iframe/sandbox.{js,html}`)_

### 2. Rebuild Micro-Apps (Optional)

The server serves single-file HTML artifacts located in `server/apps/public/`. Choose the app you want to build:

#### Option A: The Editor App

```bash
cd server/apps/editor
npm install
npm run build:all
```

_(Generates `server/apps/public/editor.html`)_

#### Option B: The Basic App

```bash
cd server/apps/src
npm install
npm run build:all
```

_(Generates `server/apps/public/app.html`)_

---

## Running the Sample

### 1. Start the MCP Server

Run this in the `server/` directory:

```bash
cd server
uv sync
uv run python server.py --transport sse --port 8000
```

### 2. Start the Host Client

Run this in the `client/` directory:

```bash
cd client
npm run start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to view the running host.
